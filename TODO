Before public release:
* use minified versions of libs for deploy
* always highlight the last move
* parse and display metatags properly

Nice to have later:
* display coordinates
* handle LOA variants (esp. 9x9 black hole)
* support BrainKing
* add victory conditions check and some animation
* put player names in the page title
