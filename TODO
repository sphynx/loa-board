Before public release:
* always highlight the last move
* add Google Analytics

Nice to have later:
* Nice error message when the game is not 8x8 classic variant
* handle LOA variants (esp. 9x9 black hole)
* support BrainKing
* add victory conditions check and some animation
* put all color/effects strings in constants
* add a field and button for loading specific game id
