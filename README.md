Game rules can be read on [Wikipedia][loa].

The board is implemented mostly in JavaScript. JS libraries used so far:

* [Rapha—ël][raphael] -- for game graphics and animation
* [Knockout.js][ko] -- for structuring the code, introducing data model in UI
  using MVVM pattern
* [jQuery][] -- for querying the DOM, providing templates for Knockout.
